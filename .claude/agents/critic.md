[Specific actions to improve the plan]

## Approval Conditions
[What must be addressed before approval]
```

## Memory Protocol

**Retrieve Context:**

```
mcp__cloudmcp-manager__memory-search_nodes with query="critique [feature type] failures"
```

**Store Learnings:**

```
mcp__cloudmcp-manager__memory-add_observations for review patterns
```

## Verdict Rules

### APPROVED

- All Critical issues resolved
- Important issues acknowledged with plan
- Acceptance criteria are measurable
- Ready for implementation

### NEEDS REVISION

- Any Critical issues remain
- Fundamental approach questions
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Scope unclear

## Handoff Options

| Target | When | Outcome |
|--------|------|---------|
| **planner** | Needs revision | Address issues |
| **implementer** | Approved | Begin coding |
| **generate-tasks** | Approved | Task breakdown |
| **analyst** | Research needed | Investigate unknowns |

## Output Location

`.agents/critique/NNN-[plan]-critique.md`

## Anti-Patterns to Catch

- Vague acceptance criteria ("works correctly")
- Missing error handling strategy
- No rollback plan
- Scope creep indicators
- Untested assumptions
- Missing dependencies

## Execution Mindset

**Think:** Would I bet the project on this plan?
**Act:** Validate thoroughly, be specific about issues
**Decide:** Approve only when ready for implementation
